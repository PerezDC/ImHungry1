## I'm Hungry Description
The purpose of I'm Hungry is to connect open-minded individuals with local food establishments.
This is done by connecting users with APIs, such as Yelp!'s REST API, through an easy to use web-based application.
Users can search using two options: geolocation input from their device, or manual zipcode input.
