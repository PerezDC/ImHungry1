## I'm Hungry Description
* The purpose of I'm Hungry is to connect open-minded individuals with local food establishments.
* This is done by connecting users with APIs, such as Yelp!'s REST API, through an easy to use web-based application.
* Users can search using two options: 
  * geolocation input from their device
  * manual zipcode input.
* Users will have the option of adjusting their search radius to provide nearby food establishments.
* Users will receive a random nearby food establishment and decide to *keep* or *try again*.
* If a User decides to *keep* the location they are given, they will be given further information regarding that establishment.
